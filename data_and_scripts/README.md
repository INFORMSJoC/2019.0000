# Data for replication

We adapt the data set provided by [Dasdemir et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2022.105882) to create the problem instances for civilian and military applications. This data set includes the elevation and coordinate data of 58 fourteeners, and the water capacity, elevation, and coordinate data of 41 water reservoirs from the State of Colorado.

There are two applications in the case study: civilian and military. Both scenarios has its own stories (please see the paper). Here, each application has its own folder with the required input data (in text files) and R scripts.
